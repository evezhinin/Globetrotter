### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

Yes, the topics discussed in the lab did prepare me to complete the assigment. The features that I felt unprepare to complete was the navigation, as there are multiple ways of doing it, but the responsive of the webpage is what makes it harder. The one I felt more unprepared to complete at the beginning was the media queries, as it was quite difficult to understand at first. 

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
if i had more time i would have added features like a map interactive, newsletter or even make the webpage more user friendly.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?


Based on the demo, what went well was my presentation, i was able to explain it under 4 minutes, but because I was nervous, my vocal skills were not clear for my peers to understand me.
